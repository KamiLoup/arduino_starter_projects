## 1. Blink LED
## 2. Traffic lights
## 3. Potentiometer
The potentiometer is just like a resistor that whose resistance varies when you turn the it.
## 4. Photo Resistor
  The photo resistor is a resistor whose resistance varies accorrding to the quantity of lights that it recives. An intence incent of light reduces its resistance and the LED will be brighter but if the incent of light is weak, the resistance increases and the LED will light up less. For this component, we'll need to read the anolog values and that's what you'll see in the code !
